                manufactured and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from October 1991 to March 1993. 
                It was introduced alongside the Quadra 900 as the first computers in the Quadra series using Motorola 68040 processor. 
                It is also the first computer from Apple to be housed in a mini-tower form factor, 
                which in 1991 was becoming a popular alternative to standard desktop-on-monitor cases that were common through the 1980s.

            <p><span>The Commodore Amiga 3000</span> is a personal computer released by Commodore in June 1990. 
                It features improved processing speed, improved graphics rendering, and a new revision of the operating system.
                The A3000UX is an A3000 variant bundled with the UNIX System V operating system. 
                Commodore had a licensing agreement with AT&T to include a port of Unix System V (release 4). 
                Commodore also sold a towerized variant called the A3000T.

            <p><span>The Commodore 64</span> is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International
                It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 12.5 and 17 million units.
                Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for US$595 (equivalent to $1,596 in 2020).
                Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its 64 kibibytes (65,536 bytes) of RAM. 
                With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation, the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware.

            <p><span>Power Mac G5</span> is a series of personal computers designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from 2003 to 2006 as part of the Power Mac series. 
                When introduced, it was the most powerful computer in Apple's Macintosh lineup, and was marketed by the company as the world's first 64-bit desktop computer.
                It was also the first desktop computer from Apple to use an anodized aluminum alloy enclosure, and one of only three computers in Apple's lineup to utilize the PowerPC 970 CPU, the others being the iMac G5 and the Xserve G5.
                Even though it remained a capable machine for a decade it was abandoned by Apple just 1 year after its release.

                The computer was launched in the spring of 1984 under the original name Kontiki-100, and was first and foremost intended for the emerging educational sector, especially for primary schools.
                The machine ran on the popular Z80 CPU, had extended graphics and sound and used a modified version of the operating system CP/M.
                At the time it was a capable machine but failed to gain traction in the consumer market.
