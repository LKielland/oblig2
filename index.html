            <p><span>The Macintosh Quadra 700</span> was a personal computer designed, 
                manufactured and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from October 1991 to March 1993. 
                It was introduced alongside the Quadra 900 as the first computers in the Quadra series using Motorola 68040 processor. 
                It is also the first computer from Apple to be housed in a mini-tower form factor, 
                which in 1991 was becoming a popular alternative to standard desktop-on-monitor cases that were common through the 1980s.
